The current project stands for creating a webserver according to HTTP/1.1 protocol (rfc 7231-7235). 
GET, POST, and DELETE are realised in this project. 
The c++98 is used as standard.
This webserver could serve a full static website.
To start a webserver use an executable "webserver" (Makefile is also presented and default rule builds the project) with config file as it's argument. 
Works on MacOs (on Linux systems may have problems).
